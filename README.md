# Smart Customer Dashboard

The personal account of the buyer (and partner) in the standard Opencart theme (OcStore), and in most other topics, is very unassuming. This add-on allows you to design your personal account at your discretion.

Capabilities:

    Create custom sections (like "My Account") and menu items (like "Change your password").

    Adding images to menu items.

    Choice of color, hover color, font size and font size of hover links of menu items.

    It is possible to indicate your link.

    It is possible to specify your own name for the menu item (multilingual).

    It is possible to specify the css design class of the menu item for full compliance with the applied theme (template).

Update from 02/28/2019:

    It is possible to add your own css code

    It is possible to edit the modules "Account" and "Partner"

    For the standard theme, it is possible to add the missing "Back" button in the sections: "Change bookmarks", "Order history", "Downloads", "Reward points", "Return requests", "Payment history", "Regular payments" and "Referrals" '

All these settings are individual for each menu item, which allows, if necessary, to highlight some item (to make a larger image for it, a link in a different color, etc.)
